LWT Release Notes
-----------------

* Release 0.9.1

CHANGE: Data read from and written to memcached is now passed directly in the
cache buffer to and from the decoding and encoding functions, eliminating the
Lua string copy (and Lua buffer) overhead. Custom decoders unable to consume
the cache buffer directly must invoke tostring() as a result of this change.


* Release 0.9.0 (2011-08-19)

Initial beta release.
